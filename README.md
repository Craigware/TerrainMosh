Terrain Mosh is an open world boss battling mania, with a focuson on boss creatures causing the terrain around them to conform to their own.

## Gameplay Mechanics
- [ ] An Open World
- [ ] 4 Unique Bosses
- [ ] Top Down Real Time Combat

### Open World
There will be only 1 level, an open wilderness for the player to explore. <br>

### Four Unique Bosses
In this world reside four large beings for the player to defeat. Each being representing a core element,
this element alters the domain of the beings. The domain of the being encompases a large around around it's current
location. Inside this location tiles are altered to fit the beings element. If two beings domains overlap eachother
a unique tile conversion occurs.

### Top Down Real Time Combat
the perspective of this will will be top down. The camera will be positioned inside of clouds. This will lead the 
player to have a [Old School Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Minish_Cap) style combat system.

## Art Style
> [!NOTE]
> I take large inspiration from [MicroMages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQ0591PAxM&ab_channel=MorphcatGames),
>  I want to try and make this game as small as posible inside of Godot The goal is to create unique visuals using
>  an asortment of 8x8 sprites. BUT I do not want to sacrifice visuals for this. <br><br> TLDR; Optimized as heck BB
<br>

### Style
All sprites will be broken up into 8x8 images, these images will be movable seperatly on the screen.
This might make the character look broken up and janky, but I think could lead to a very visually interesting style
<br>

### Color Pallete
Game Boy Color Type 1 (Asesprite Default Included)


## Software Tools
- Asesprite
- Godot, C# Mono
