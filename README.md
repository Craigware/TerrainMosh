## Art Style
> [!NOTE]
> I take large inspiration from [MicroMages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWQ0591PAxM&ab_channel=MorphcatGames),
>  I want to try and make this game as small as posible inside of Godot The goal is to create unique visuals using
>  an asortment of 8x8 sprites. BUT I do not want to sacrifice visuals for this. <br><br> TLDR; Optimized as heck BB

### Style
All sprites will be broken up into 8x8 images, these images will be movable seperatly on the screen.
This might make the character look broken up and janky, but I think could lead to a very visually interesting style
### Color Pallete
Game Boy Color Type 1 (Asesprite Default Included)


## Software Tools
- Asesprite
- Godot, C# Mono
